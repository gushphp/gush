```bash
gush core:init
```
did you try? you must have a default or a .gush.yml locally

upon conversing with @aequasi we found 2 things:

1. cert error on phar needs fixing
2. avoid cert error or other to wipe global ~/.gush/.gush.yml file

could you please confirm/hint on this @aequasi @sstok

Would also be cool to have a `cache-clear` method for gush, and are `local` and `local_file` necessary in the global config?

both should be removed imo

@aequasi the error does not go away even with locking guzzle to 3.9.0
puzzled on why it gives this weird error, maybe box changed? but the phar is created by a box install that had not changed at all either.

@kherge something changed in box or something because this used to work.
Also i am thinking we may need to use a custom stub? because the nuance with guzzle/guzzle3 now moving its own cert  into the temporary folder in their stub makes it so (or at least that is what i think is happening) that we have to do the same in our custom stub?

I am trying to read how to create a custom stub, but cannot find it, could you please point me to an example?

@sstok are we onto something here?
