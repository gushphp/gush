oh this is true, because those options get decorated only on application initialization/bootstrap via event listener. so definitely when they are fetched without they will not have those options on...

you must be maintaining release branches to do this @lunika , right?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

totally unrelated : make sure you don\'t miss now what bldr gush block is capable of https://github.com/cordoval/matthew-7-12/blob/master/.bldr/tasks.yml#L98-L110

Yes I want to use gush for managing releases branch but I think the command can\'t do this because most of time the PR is not mine, so I can\'t squash it.

yes, @sstok has already a ticket for this on issues, have you checked?

We can get the org and repo from the \'main\' command and then pass them with the subcommand.

```php
        $command = $this->getApplication()->find(\'pull-request:squash\');
        $input = new ArrayInput(
            [
                \'command\' => \'pull-request:squash\',
                \'pr_number\' => $prNumber,
                \'org\' => $input->getOption(\'org\'),
                \'repo\' => $input->getOption(\'repo\')
            ]
        );
        $command->run($input, $output);
```

And the same goes for the other subcommands.
