I will comply, i hope this solves your problem, really sorry I have been just busy and i was a bit confused by this because I had intentionally left this out https://github.com/gushphp/gush/commit/944d9fed419383c57265d12d7ee8918569b4b992 as you can see in the commit history. I did it purposefully but i forgot now. In any case i think let's try.
