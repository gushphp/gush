we should use and promote the upgrade to latest git imo, but yeah let\'s warn with version. We already have a check for presence in the gush script i believe so let\'s add it there. I even believe there could already be a package for this?

p:create is used a lot, and this automation is wanted a lot, so no escape, we have to fire a warning saying git needs upgrading.
