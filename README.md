*Logo explanation is best presented from this passage in Psalms 78*:

> True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread?
> Can he supply meat for his people?” When the Lord heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against
> Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.
> 
> There first thread of blood and the following are water gushing out of a rock, connecting the Old Testament
> prophecy fulfillment in the New Testament at the cross when Jesus was opened on his side and gushed out
> water and blood.
