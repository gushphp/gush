*Logo explanation is best depicted from this passage from Psalms 78*:

> True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread?
> Can he supply meat for his people?” When the Lord heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against
> Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.

There first thread of blood and the following are water gushing out of a rock, connecting the Old Testament
prophecy fulfillment in the New Testament at the cross when Jesus was opened on his side and gushed out
water and blood.

### What is this?

Gush is an app console whose intention is to automate common maintainer and contributor tasks.

- creates a Pull Request with a formatted table description of the changes
- creates github release notes
- changes the base branch of a Pull Request
- automates retrieval of issue's message, title and comments as a text
- merges a PR with just the number and includes all github discussion on the commit message
- and much more in the form of intuitive commands!

### Install

Install Gush in two ways:

#### 1) Installing system-wide using composer (recommended)

```bash
$ composer global require 'cordoval/gush=dev-master'
```

If it is the first time you globally install a dependency then make sure
you include `~/.composer/vendor/bin` in $PATH as shown [here](http://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#global).

### Keep your Gush install always updated:

```bash
$ composer global update cordoval/gush
```

#### 2) Installing as a phar file:

```
$ curl -sS http://gushphp.org/installer | php
$ mv gush.phar /usr/local/bin/gush // optionally
```

or

```
$ curl -sS http://gushphp.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=bin
```

### Usage

You may want to start by configuring it:

```bash
$ gush configure
Insert your github credentials:
username: cordoval
// ...
Configuration saved successfully.
```

Let's go into a repo, list issues, take one, send a pull request and merge it:

List it:
```bash
$ cd project_directory
$ gush issue:list

Take it:
```bash
