this is known, could you check an early tag? I am aware of this since it is showing on the tests.

also try to install via cloning and not via composer global or phar
the best method so far is to clone, run composer install and ten symlink to your path
then just gush core:configure

@lmammino could you please test on master or the last tag again in a few mins? I will merge this and tag. It has some failing test but it is not related.
