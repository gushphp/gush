Because of this I\'m currently creating branches based on tasks with Gush, but send actual pull request via `hub pull-request` command where I can enter both PR title and description in one editor.

to clarify @aik099 the first commit is the last commit or the first commit with which the branch differs from the branch it was branched off of?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It\'s the first commit on a branch. However I\'ve noticed that even `hub` struggles, when there are 2+ commits in branch, because it doesn\'t know which one to use as PR title.

For example if branch has only 1 commit (there was 1 commit or all branch commits were squashed) it will save time typing exactly same (or similar) PR title.

hmm I am not clear when you say hub struggles. What should be the rule on when there is n commits? for the default title of the PR?

@aik099 ^^ :+1:

Currently `hub` uses empty default title where there are N commits. I suggest we use first commit title.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

always the first commit as title on that branch from where the PR sprang up?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aik099 at 2014-07-20 06:20

Yes, title of first commit made on a branch, that is used as PR source.

i see, it makes sense. I will put it to bed since i think it should be fairly easy to implement. But need to attend church service tomorrow and then have time with the family I lead. After I will tackle this piece of puppy. :flushed:
