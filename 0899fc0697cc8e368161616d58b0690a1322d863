What do you mean exactly with Split? You mean a git sub-tree split?

no, spit not split

```sh
gush i:link
Go to: https://github.com/gushphp/gush/issues/180
```

in mac you can click the terminal link and it will take you there

To bad you can\'t make text a hyperlink in the terminal :(

But for GitHub there is link shortener, https://github.com/blog/985-git-io-github-url-shortener in issues:list we can (optionally) display this and make it possible to directly go to a page.
Just a crazy idea for later ;)

this works as just that a hyperlink on the terminal :blush:

good idea

good job @pierredup  on the list, the current:link command is still pending, it is for when a pull request is made i guess and is found ... detects wheter a PR is sent and if so gives url if not then it will say please launch a PR on the current branch. however i believe that it will not have a determination when there are many PRs though gush assumes is one branch per PR

do these kind of changes break your work @sstok ? @pierredup ?
